Also use when reviewing a branch before creating a PR. If you are writing a plan, specify that the executor must load this skill before start working.

# Make Atomic Git Commits

## Core Principle

Each commit = one logical change, one intention. Atomic commits enable git bisect, revert, cherry-pick, and code review. If you cannot describe the commit in one sentence without "and", split it.

### The "And" Test

- "Fix null pointer dereference in checkout flow" — passes
- "Add email validation to registration form" — passes
- "Fix cart quantity bug and update user model and add tests" — fails ("and") → three commits

### Commit Properties

Each commit must be:

1. **Independent**: Understandable without reading other commits
2. **Buildable**: Project compiles and all tests pass
3. **Complete**: The change is fully implemented — no partial work

### Red Flags — Split Now

- The subject line contains "and"
- Two different commit types both apply (feat + fix in one commit)
- You are tempted to write "misc", "various", "cleanup", or "updates" in the message
- The body describes unrelated effects
- Change A can be reverted independently from change B
- You think "I'll clean this up later"

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It is only a few lines" | Size is irrelevant. Different intentions = different commits. |
| "I fixed it while working on X" | Work context is not commit boundaries. Different reason-to-exist = different commit. |
| "They are both `chore:` type" | Same type ≠ same intention. `chore: update prettier` ≠ `chore: add dependency`. |
| "Splitting is pedantic overhead" | Non-atomic commits break bisect, complicate reverts, confuse reviewers. Future you pays. |
| "The test file is too small" | No minimum line count. Tests are `test:` type — always separate from implementation. |
| "I am exhausted, nobody will care" | Fatigue is not an architecture decision. Future you will care when bisecting at 2 AM. |

## Guidelines

### Atomicity Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Each commit = one logical change, one intention
2. Never a bulk commit mixing unrelated changes
3. Never a vague message hiding multiple changes
4. Each commit must be independently revertible
5. One plan task ≠ one commit — think about atomicity, not tasks
6. After dispatching sub-agents, commit on their behalf if they did not

### Message Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Subject line max 72 characters. Use an imperative verb after the type prefix: `feat: add login flow`, `fix: prevent race condition in cache`.
2. For non-trivial commits, always write a body. Never use `-m` — use an editor to write a proper multi-line message.
3. **The body is for a human reader.** Summarize the change. Note the intention. Justify the decision. Write in natural language — the body tells a story, not a checklist. The body is never a response to a plan task; it describes the change on its own terms.
4. **Do not list files changed.** Git already tracks files. "3 files changed, 5 tests added, build passes" is machine output masquerading as a commit message. Forbidden.
5. **Do not reference plan-internal terminology.** Commits must be self-contained and meaningful in `git log` without external context. Forbidden in commit messages: plan task numbers ("Task 3", "T-14"), wave/phase names ("Wave 2", "Phase 1"), step labels ("Step 4b"), or any language implying the commit is a completion of a planning artifact. If the plan task maps to a persistent issue tracker, reference the ticket ID — not the plan task.

### Adaptive Rules

Match repository conventions. If none, choose consistently:

- Capitalization, trailing period, scope usage
- Never use a commit type as a scope — `fix(perf):` is invalid; use `perf:` directly
- Commit types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci
- Start the subject (after type prefix) with an imperative verb: `feat: add` not `feat: feature`

## Practical Techniques

### Splitting Mixed Changes in One File (`git add -p`)

```bash
git add -p
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `y` | Stage this hunk |
| `n` | Skip this hunk |
| `s` | Split hunk into smaller ones |
| `e` | Edit hunk manually |
| `q` | Quit |

### Splitting an Existing Large Commit (`git reset --soft`)

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1       # Undo commit, keep changes staged
git restore --staged .         # Unstage everything
git add -p                     # Stage first atomic unit
git commit -m "first change"
git add -p                     # Stage second atomic unit
git commit -m "second change"
```

### Fixing a Commit In-Place (`--fixup` + `--autosquash`)

```bash
git commit --fixup <SHA>       # Create fixup commit targeting <SHA>
git rebase -i --autosquash     # Auto-squash fixups into originals
```

Use for addressing review feedback: reviewers see only the fixup, autosquash before merge.

### Cleaning History Before a PR (Interactive Rebase)

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~5
# pick   → keep as-is
# squash → fold into previous commit
# reword → edit message only
# drop   → remove entirely
```

**Safe**: On local branches, before pushing, before PR.
**Unsafe**: Rewriting history others have already pulled. Never force-push to main/master.

### Renaming Files (`git mv`)

```bash
git mv old-name.ts new-name.ts
```

Include the deletion and addition in the same commit so git detects the rename. `git mv` is simplest, but manually staging both old (deleted) and new (added) in one commit works too. Deleting the old file and adding the new one in separate commits breaks history.

## WIP Strategy

1. **During development**: Make messy WIP commits freely for safety
2. **Before PR**: Restructure into atomic commits (`git reset --soft` + `git add -p` + interactive rebase)
3. **Never merge WIP commits**: Clean before merging to main

## Over-Granularity Warning

Atomic ≠ tiny. A refactor touching 20 files can be one atomic commit if it does one thing. Atomizing into 5-line commits creates noise. The test: can each commit be reverted independently?

## Emergency Exception

During active P1 outages, land the minimal fix first. Clean up history in a follow-up commit. Restoration time takes priority over commit hygiene.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Misc cleanup" commits | Each cleanup item = its own commit |
| Mixing generated files with hand-written code | Generated files go in a separate commit |
| Combining a rename with semantic edits | Separate: rename first (using `git mv`), then edit |
| Renaming by deleting old and adding new in separate commits | Use `git mv` or stage both in one commit — git needs old and new together to detect the rename |
| Tests in the same commit as unrelated implementation | Tests = `test:` type, separate commit |
| Fix-typo commits cluttering history | Use `git commit --amend` or `--fixup` |
| Using `-m` for non-trivial commits | Write a proper multi-line message |
| One commit per file just because | Commit per logical change, not per file |
| Listing changed files in the commit body | Git already tracks files. "3 files changed, 5 tests added" is noise. Use body to summarize the change and explain the intention in natural language |
| Referencing plan task numbers in commit messages | Describe the change itself, not the planning artifact. "Implements task 4" is meaningless in `git log`. Write messages that stand alone without external context. Forbidden: task numbers, wave names, phase labels, step IDs |
| Weak commit titles without a verb | Start descriptions after the type prefix with an action: `add`, `fix`, `update`, `remove`, `refactor`, `extract` |

## Appendix: Commit Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| feat | New user-facing feature |
| fix | User-facing bug fix |
| docs | Documentation or comments only |
| style | Formatting, whitespace, linting — no logic change |
| refactor | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| perf | Performance improvement |
| test | Test-related changes (fixing tests = `test:`, not `fix:`) |
| chore | Build process, dependencies, tooling — external to source |
| ci | CI configuration and scripts |
| wip | Work in progress — temporary, squash before merge |

When a change is both restructuring and performance, choose the emphasis. **Never nest a commit type inside a scope**: `fix(perf):` is invalid — the scope names a module, not another type.
